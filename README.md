# Full-Circle-Website

This site is the first site I ever worked on. As part of my BTEC Level 3 IT course, we had to research, design, develop and publish a website for someone that we know. I chose to do this for my karate club, Full Circle Martial Arts.

The site was built using the WYSIWYG option in Adobe Dreamweaver 2013, so a lot of modern practices won't be found here. For instance, the pages are built using a table element designed to fit a laptop/desktop monitor, not a responsive design. 

The navigation on the main menu also consists of links containing images with text (it's best practice to use just text instead of have the text within an image wherever possible). This was in order to create the rollover effect whereby the links and imagery would change colour when you hovered over them. Such an effect can be achieved through CSS alone now.

Finally, the videos and galleries no longer work as originally, Adobe Flash Player was a common add-on to browsers and was the most common way to display videos and image galleries at the time. Since then, browsers have dropped support for Adobe Flash Player and instead, videos have received native support through HTML. There have been more advancements in JavaScript with the likes of jQuery, React, Angular etc. that makes creating carousels for image galleries a lot simpler.
